 If you are reading this means you are looking me up! Thanks for that. Let me give you quick info on myself. I'm a Lead Frontend Engineer @ <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/" target="_blank">Freshworks</a>. I started my career as Hybrid Mobile App developer, then became an UX Enthusiast. A believer of **Atwood's law** -

  🎯 &nbsp;&nbsp; Recently Interested in Web Accessibility <br/>
  🤓 &nbsp;&nbsp; Probably one of very few developers using Ember JS<br/>
